//! # TF-IDF Vectorizer + Cosine Similarity
//!
//! Foundational text-representation layer used by every retrieval mechanism in
//! Aether Engine (the semantic memory graph, the action cache, the distillation
//! store, the CLT convergence detector, and the context compressor all build
//! on top of this module).
//!
//! Implemented from scratch — **no external ML dependencies**. Sparse vectors
//! are stored as `HashMap<String, f64>` (term → TF-IDF weight) plus a
//! precomputed L2 norm so that cosine similarity is O(min(|a|, |b|)) rather
//! than O(|a| + |b|).
//!
//! # Weighting Scheme
//!
//! - **IDF** uses sklearn-style smoothing to keep it finite on unseen terms:
//!   `idf(t) = ln((1 + N) / (1 + df(t))) + 1`
//! - **TF** is normalized by the maximum raw term frequency in the document
//!   (so a single term repeated 100 times doesn't dominate).
//! - The resulting vector is **not** re-normalized to unit length; instead
//!   the L2 norm is stored alongside the terms so cosine can divide once
//!   per comparison rather than per query.
//!
//! # Where it sits in the pipeline
//!
//! Innovations 1 (semantic memory graph), 4 (distillation), 6 (action cache),
//! and 9 (CLT convergence) all consume the [`cosine`] / [`SparseVec`] types
//! defined here.
